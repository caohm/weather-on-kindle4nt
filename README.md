weather-on-kindle4nt
=====================

## Features

- The original function as an ebook reader remains

- Doesn't require any crontab usage

- Caches the last successfully downloaded weather file until it expires at 24:00
  (So you can take away your 'weather station' in the pub and show it all your friends.)

- The download is written in the '/tmp' directory which is a temporary filesystem(32M), living in the memory
