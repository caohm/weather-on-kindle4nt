kindle4nt-weather
=================

Note : All scripts are compatible with the dash shell on your host system.

Features:

- Doesn't need any crontab usage

- Caches the last successfully downloaded weather file until it expires at 24:00
  (So you can take away your 'weather station' in the pub and show it your friends.)

- Could invoke within a wrapper called 'launcher.sh'

- The download is written in the '/tmp' directory which is a temporary filesystem, living in the memory

Installation:

Copy this directory onto your Kindle's SD card.
